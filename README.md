# Speed Carts Rerailed

This mod adds the ability to control minecarts with signs, but in many more ways than the original.
All you need to do is place a sign beside the rail, and put either a number, color, or name on the first line of the sign that indicates the desired speed of the train in meters per second, the line of the train, and the next station respectively.
